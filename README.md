Introduction
------------

Caltech Librarians need to identify what is and is not on the shelves of the library stacks.  One of the processes currently being used is to scan the barcodes of items on the shelves and compare the results to what is expected, based on the library's information management system.  Check It! is a program to take a list of barcodes and create a spreadsheet of information about the items determined from Caltech.tind.io.


Installation
------------

The developers provide an installer program for Caltech Library users.  Please contact the developers to get a copy of the installer program for Windows 7, Windows 10, or macOS 10.12+.  Note also that installation of _Check It!_ on Windows requires administrator priviledges.

Alternatively, you can also build the program from the source code.
First, use `git` to clone a copy of the program source tree from the GitHub 
repository to your local computer disk:
```sh
