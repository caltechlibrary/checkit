Icon artwork for Check It!
==========================

The SVG icon in the file [noun_bar code_2096134.svg](noun_bar code_2096134.svg) was created by [Ravindra Kalkani](https://thenounproject.com/ravindrakalkani/) as part of the [Noun Project](https://thenounproject.com/term/bar-code/2096134/).

The file [checkit-icon.svg](checkit-icon.svg) contains a slightly modified version of the icon created by Mike Hucka.  The color has been changed and text removed so that I can be used as an application icon for this project.
