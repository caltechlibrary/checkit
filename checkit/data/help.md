Installing and uninstalling Check It!
-----------------------------------

The developers provide an installer program for Caltech Library users.  Please contact the developers to get a copy of the installer program for Windows 7, Windows 10, or macOS 10.12+.  Note also that installation of Check It! on Windows requires administrator priviledges.

To uninstall Check It! on a Windows 10 system, use the normal Windows **Add or remove programs** facility in the **Systems Settings** panel.


Using Check It!
---------------

Check It! has both a GUI interface and a command-line interface.  The GUI interface is simple: a user starts the program in a typical way (e.g., by double-clicking the program icon) and Check It! creates a main window, then immediately begins its work by connecting to caltech.tind.io and asking the user for information.
